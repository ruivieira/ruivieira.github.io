The &ldquo;<em>USA Trilogy</em>&rdquo; is frequently cited as a significant exploration of American life in the early 20th century, using techniques like the &ldquo;<em>Newsreel</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Camera Eye</em>&rdquo; to tell his narratives. From the discussions and summaries I&rsquo;ve encountered, Dos Passos seemed to have a knack for interweaving fiction with the pressing sociopolitical issues of his era. It&rsquo;s intriguing to think about the depth of his works without having directly experienced them.</p><figure><img src=https://ruivieira.dev/assets/john_dos_passos.jpg alt=john_dos_passos.jpg loading=lazy></figure><h3 id=gazette-and-scroll x-intersect="currentHeading = '#gazette-and-scroll'">Gazette and scroll</h3><p>I was considering moving the entirety of the blog (not the site, just these pages) to <code>scroll</code>.
Unfortunately, <code>scroll</code> is not a great fit for the rest of the site&rsquo;s workflow.</p><p>At the moment, it&rsquo;s a bit of a compromise. I&rsquo;m using the <em>Gazette</em> style for the blog page, but it&rsquo;s just the CSS.
The underlying process of building the site is the same (still using Markdown).</p><h3 id=a-thought-on-important x-intersect="currentHeading = '#a-thought-on-important'">A thought on !important</h3><p>In <a href>CSS</a>, <code>!important</code> is really not a good idea. It&rsquo;s make debugging very time-consuming and fundamentally breaks the <em>Cascading</em> part of CSS.</p><h3 id=reducing-software-bugs x-intersect="currentHeading = '#reducing-software-bugs'">Reducing software bugs</h3><p>Just read Daniel J. Bernstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0</em>&rdquo; <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1314466.1314467>paper</a> on mitigating software bugs, I found these to be the main takeaways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Code Reviews Matter</strong>: By thoroughly reviewing your code, you can get a sense of its vulnerability to bugs. This isn&rsquo;t just about finding immediate errors, but evaluating the overall quality of your software-development approach. Adjust your strategies based on these reviews for better outcomes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Measuring Bugs</strong>: There are two primary ways to gauge the &lsquo;bugginess&rsquo; of software—either by looking at the bugs per specific task or bugs per line of code. Each approach has its merits. While the former can give insights into the efficiency of a task, the latter can be an indicator of how long debugging might take.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eliminate Risky Habits</strong>: In coding, as in life, some habits are more prone to mistakes than others. Identifying these risky behaviours and addressing them head-on can dramatically cut down on errors. This might even mean reshaping the coding environment or tools used.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Virtue of Brevity</strong>: A larger codebase naturally has more room for errors. If two processes achieve the same result, but one does it with fewer lines of code, the latter is generally preferable. It&rsquo;s not about cutting corners but about efficiency and clarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Access Control</strong>: Just as you wouldn&rsquo;t give every employee a key to the company safe, not all code should have unrestricted access. By architecting systems that limit code permissions, you add another layer of protection against potential issues.</p></li></ol><p>In conclusion, a proactive, thoughtful approach to coding—paired with smart strategies and tools can significantly reduce software bugs.</p><h3 id=issue-bankruptcy x-intersect="currentHeading = '#issue-bankruptcy'">Issue bankruptcy</h3><p>Today <a href=https://github.com/lodash/lodash>Lodash</a> declared &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22issue+bankruptcy%22">issue bankruptcy</a>&rdquo; and closed 363 issues 325 PRs to start afresh.</p></p><footer id=footer><div class=footer-left>Copyright &copy; 2023 Rui Vieira</div><div class=footer-right><nav><ul><li><a href=https://ruivieira.dev/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://ruivieira.dev/blog/>Blog</a></li><li><a href=https://ruivieira.dev/draw/>Drawings</a></li><li><a href=https://ruivieira.dev/map/>All pages</a></li><li><a href=https://ruivieira.dev/search.html>Search</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=https://ruivieira.dev/css/fa.min.css><script src=https://ruivieira.dev/js/jquery-3.6.0.min.js></script>
