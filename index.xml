I was having something of a framework fatigue after switching between a few static site generators. Each new generator I decided to try implied usually either learning a new programming language (Python, Ruby, Go) to perform basic setup and a new template engine syntax1. Typically I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using the vast majority of the features available for each generator. And finally, most of the generators I tried over the years rely on heavy configuration if I want to maintain the site organisation and look.</description></item><item><title>58 bytes of CSS to look great nearly everywhere</title><link>/58-bytes-of-css-to-look-great-nearly-everywhere.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/58-bytes-of-css-to-look-great-nearly-everywhere.html</guid><description>The original page seems to have disappeared from the Internet1 (see: link rot), so the original contents are kept here.

Crystal is a statically typed language with a syntax resembling Ruby&amp;rsquo;s. The main features which drawn me to it were its simple boilerplate-free syntax (which is ideal for quick prototyping), tied with the ability to compile directly to native code along with a dead simple way of creating bindings to existing C code.
These features make it quite attractive, in my opinion, for scientific computing.</description></item><item><title>A simple Python benchmark exercise</title><link>/a-simple-python-benchmark-exercise.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/a-simple-python-benchmark-exercise.html</guid><description>Recently when discussing the Crystal language and specifically the Gibbs sample blog post with a colleague, he mentioned that the Python benchmark numbers looked a bit off and not consistent with his experience of numerical programming in Python.

Validity Actionability Sparsity Data manifold closeness Causality Amortised inference Validity We assume that a counterfactual is valid if it solves the optimisation as states in Wachter et al2. If we defined the loss function as
$$ L(x,x^{\prime},y^{\prime},\lambda)=\lambda\times(\hat{f}(x^{\prime})−y^{\prime})^2+d(x,x^{\prime}), $$
we can define the counterfactual as
$$ \arg \underset{x^{\prime}}{\min}\underset{\lambda}{\max} \lambda\times(\hat{f}(x^{\prime})−y^{\prime})^2+d(x,x^{\prime}) $$
where:
$x \in \mathcal{X}$ is the original data point $x^{\prime} \in \mathcal{X}$ is the counterfactual $y^{\prime} \in \mathcal{Y}$ is the desired label $d$ is a distance metric to measure the distance between $x$ and $x^{\prime}$.</description></item><item><title>Counterfactuals with Constraint Solvers</title><link>/counterfactuals-with-constraint-solvers.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/counterfactuals-with-constraint-solvers.html</guid><description>Scoring An implementation on how to calculate counterfactuals with Constraint Solvers (namely OptaPlanner) is available here.

The first hard level component, 1, penalises the score according to the distance between the prediction, $y^{\prime}$ for the currently proposed solution, $x^{\prime}$ and the original prediction $y$, that is this our $(\hat{f}(x^{\prime})-y^{\prime})^2$.</description></item><item><title>Deno</title><link>/deno.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/deno.html</guid><description>Installation Fedora To install Deno on Fedora, first download the installation file:

It is used in such diverse fields as Natural Language Processing (NLP), social sciences and medical sciences.
The core idea behind K-means is that we want to group data in clusters. Data points will be assigned to a specific cluster depending on it&amp;rsquo;s distance to a cluster&amp;rsquo;s center, usually called the centroid.
It is important to note that typically, the mean distance to a centroid is used to partition the clusters, however, difference distances can be used and different pivot points.</description></item><item><title>k8s operators</title><link>/k8s-operators.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/k8s-operators.html</guid><description>OpenShift Installing To install a k8s operator, define the subscription with, for instance opendatahub-operator.yaml:

MCSI has several applications in the field of computer vision and trajectory fitting. MCSI further guarantees monotonicity of the smoothed approximation, something which a cubic spline approximation alone cannot. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to implement the method developed by F. N. Fritsch and R. E.

This tree will be split in order to minimise some criteria function.
However, it is not desirable that individual DTs get too large with too many splits, so a common approach is to train each tree with a subset of the training data (sampled with replacement). This will ensure that individual tree maintain a manageable size, while the variance of the tree ensemble is reduced and the overall bias is not altered.</description></item><item><title>OpenShift</title><link>/openshift.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/openshift.html</guid><description>Notes on OpenShift1.

Due to the dependance on ranks, the Spearman&amp;rsquo;s $\rho$ is used for ordinal value, although discrete and continous values are possible.

For this section we will mainly use scikit-learn&amp;rsquo;s make_regression method.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Data Generation with SDV</title><link>/synthetic-data-generation-with-sdv.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/synthetic-data-generation-with-sdv.html</guid><description> Synthetic data with SDV and Gaussian copulas Synthetic data with SDV and CTGAN Synthetic data with SDV and CopulaGAN</description></item><item><title>Synthetic data with SDV and CopulaGAN</title><link>/synthetic-data-with-svd-and-copulagan.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/synthetic-data-with-svd-and-copulagan.html</guid><description>import pandas as pd import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(&amp;#39;ignore&amp;#39;) data = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;data/svm-hyperparameters-train-features.csv&amp;#34;) data.head() Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare 0 3 1 22.0 1 0 7.2500 1 1 0 38.0 1 0 71.2833 2 3 0 26.0 0 0 7.9250 3 1 0 35.0 1 0 53.1000 4 3 1 35.0 0 0 8.0500 data.describe(include=&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;) Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare count 891.000000 891.000000 891.000000 891.000000 891.000000 891.000000 mean 2.308642 0.647587 29.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic data with SDV and CTGAN</title><link>/synthetic-data-with-sdv-and-ctgan.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/synthetic-data-with-sdv-and-ctgan.html</guid><description>Synthetic data with SDV and CTGAN import pandas as pd import warnings warnings.filterwarnings(&amp;#39;ignore&amp;#39;) data = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;data/svm-hyperparameters-train-features.csv&amp;#34;) data.head() Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare 0 3 1 22.0 1 0 7.2500 1 1 0 38.0 1 0 71.2833 2 3 0 26.0 0 0 7.9250 3 1 0 35.0 1 0 53.1000 4 3 1 35.0 0 0 8.0500 data.describe(include=&amp;#39;all&amp;#39;) Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare count 891.000000 891.000000 891.000000 891.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic data with SVD and Gaussian copulas</title><link>/synthetic-data-with-svd-and-gaussian-copulas.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/synthetic-data-with-svd-and-gaussian-copulas.html</guid><description>import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(&amp;#34;data/svm-hyperparameters-train-features.csv&amp;#34;) data.head() Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare 0 3 1 22.000 1 0 7.250 1 1 0 38.000 1 0 71.283 2 3 0 26.000 0 0 7.925 3 1 0 35.000 1 0 53.100 4 3 1 35.000 0 0 8.050 data.describe(include=&amp;#34;all&amp;#34;) Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare count 891.000 891.000 891.000 891.000 891.000 891.000 mean 2.309 0.648 29.759 0.523 0.382 32.</description></item><item><title>t as mixture of Normals</title><link>/t-as-mixture-of-normals.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 10:49:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>/t-as-mixture-of-normals.html</guid><description>(Based on Rasmus Bååth&amp;rsquo;s post)
A scaled $t$ distribution, with $\mu$ mean, $s$ scale and $\nu$ degrees of freedom, can be simulated
from a mixture of Normals with $\mu$ mean and precisions following a Gamma distribution:
$$ \begin{aligned} y &amp;amp;\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\sigma\right) \\ \sigma^2 &amp;amp;\sim \mathcal{IG}\left(\frac{\nu}{2},s^2\frac{\nu}{2}\right) \end{aligned} $$

So perhaps, if have a large-ish USB pen or an external drive, chances are you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to reformat it.
